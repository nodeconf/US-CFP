As you may have seen we had to cancel the speaking event at the [Fox Theatre](https://medium.com/@mikeal/nodeconf-fox-theatre-event-cancelled-67bf6b3de4dc).

You're welcome to join us at Walker Creek Ranch for [NodeConf Adventure](https://ti.to/nodeconf/adventure) which is an un-conference with attendee driven worksshops and discussion sessions. If you'd like to submit a topic in that format and you're planning on attending just log an issue in the [Adventure repo](https://github.com/nodeconf/Adventure-UNCONF).
