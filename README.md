# NodeConf US 2015

NodeConf US 2015 will be at the Fox Theatre in Oakland, CA, on June 8th and 9th.

This year we're doing this a little differently. Rather than solicit proposals we're asking people what they would like to see at the conference.

* What excites you about Node?
* What projects are the most interesting to you?
* Who have you never seen who you think has been doing amazing work but hasn't given a talk yet.

Please do **not** send proposals for talks that *you* would give. Feel free to post links to projects you've done or talks you've done that you think are worth taking a look at but don't send proposals for a talk.

NodeConf will follow up on all these projects and build a two day narrative of talks by reaching out to individuals an asking them to give a talk about a specific subject.
